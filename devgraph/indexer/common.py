    ends are always the file currently being parsed), setting it makes the
    MATCH in engine.py require that node's `file` property too, instead of
    matching by name alone. Leave it None for endpoints whose file genuinely
    isn't knowable from syntax alone (e.g. a CALLS target, which could be
    defined anywhere in the repo) -- that keeps today's bare-name matching,
    ambiguity and all, since guessing wrong there would silently drop edges
